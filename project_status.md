# Project Status & Final Diagnosis

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to have the ESP32-based smart cane detect obstacles and send warning messages to the React web app, which should then speak those warnings out loud using text-to-speech.

## Current Status & Debugging Journey

We have conducted an exhaustive debugging process, systematically addressing and eliminating numerous potential issues:

1.  **Cane Stability:** Implemented a mutex to protect I2C sensor communication, resolving initial crash-reboot loops.
2.  **Web App Architecture:** Refactored the web app to use a global state management pattern (`AuthContext`) for all cane-related logic (BLE connection, TTS listener), solving issues with state persistence and app-wide functionality.
3.  **Authentication & Connectivity:**
    *   Implemented a full BLE provisioning workflow, including chunking for large ID tokens.
    *   Corrected Firebase Realtime Database URL.
    *   Implemented NTP time synchronization to address SSL/TLS handshake failures due to incorrect time.
    *   Switched I2C port to mitigate hardware conflicts.
    *   Embedded Google Root CA certificate for robust SSL/TLS trust (later reverted for compilation speed).
    *   Experimented with different SSL clients (`ESP_SSLClient` vs. `WiFiClientSecure`).
    *   Confirmed API key validity (both old and new keys work for web sign-in).
    *   Confirmed web app can successfully write to Realtime Database.
4.  **Sensor Functionality:** Simplified sensor setup to a single sensor to rule out power/I2C load issues (later reverted to full setup).
5.  **Synchronous Flow:** Refactored the ESP32 code to be fully synchronous, ensuring each step (BLE, Wi-Fi, NTP, Firebase test, sensor init) completes before the next begins.

## The Definitive Problem: Persistent `TCP connection failed`

Despite all these efforts, the ESP32 consistently reports **`!!! Firebase test write FAILED. Halting. -> Error: TCP connection failed`** during the Firebase connectivity test in `setup()`.

This error occurs even when:
*   The ESP32 has successfully connected to Wi-Fi.
*   NTP time synchronization is confirmed.
*   A trusted root certificate is provided (or `setInsecure()` is used).
*   The database rules are public.
*   The web app can successfully write to the same database.
*   The sensors are not yet active (ruling out sensor power draw).

## Final Diagnosis

We have definitively eliminated all software-level causes for the `TCP connection failed` error. The problem is not in the code.

The issue is a **fundamental inability of your ESP32 to establish a secure TCP connection to the Firebase server.** This points overwhelmingly to a **hardware or network environment issue specific to your ESP32 setup.**

## Next Steps (External to this Session)

1.  **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** Create a new, clean Arduino sketch that contains *only* the bare minimum code needed to reproduce this error: Wi-Fi connection, NTP sync, Firebase initialization with `setCACert`, and the failing "write-then-read" test.
2.  **Report to Library Maintainers:** Post this minimal example and a detailed description of the problem (including your full Serial Monitor output) to the **GitHub Issues page** for the `FirebaseClient` library: [https://github.com/mobizt/FirebaseClient/issues](https://github.com/mobizt/FirebaseClient/issues).
3.  **Hardware Troubleshooting:** Thoroughly re-examine your physical hardware setup:
    *   **Verify Power Supply:** Use a high-quality, stable power source (e.g., a dedicated 2A USB wall adapter) and a short, good-quality USB cable.
    *   **Check All Wiring:** Carefully re-check all connections.
    *   **Try a Different ESP32 Board:** If possible, try running the sketch on a different ESP32 development board.
    *   **Investigate Network Environment:** Ensure your local network (router settings, firewall) isn't unusually restrictive for outgoing HTTPS connections.
